# intrusion-detection with deep neural detectors

Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
• Implemented an Intrusion Detection System using deep neural detectors to efficiently identify and respond to potential security
threats in the network, mitigating the risk of data loss and downtime.
• Conducted comprehensive analysis on 12 different network attack datasets and evaluated the performance of 4 deep neural detectors. Reported insights into the limitations and effectiveness of methods.

Initial Experiment were conducted on 4 binary classification datasets:
1. NSL-KDD
2. CICIDS2017
3. UNSW_NB15
4. Kitsune Network Attack
